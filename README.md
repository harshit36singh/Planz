## 🎨 Key Features Explained

### Priority System
Tasks are color-coded based on priority:
- 🟢 **Low** - Green
- 🔵 **Medium** - Blue  
- 🟠 **High** - Orange
- 🔴 **Urgent** - Red

Each task card has a color-coded left border and subtle background glow.

### Voice Command Parser
Natural language processing supports:
- Date parsing: "today", "tomorrow", "December 15", "next Monday"
- Time parsing: "at 3 PM", "at 15:30"
- Action words: "add", "schedule", "remind me to"

Example commands:
```
"Add task finish project report"
"Schedule dentist appointment tomorrow at 2 PM"
"Remind me to call John on Friday at 10 AM"
```

### Timeline View
24-hour schedule visualization:
- Hourly slots from 12:00 AM to 11:00 PM
- Current hour highlighted
- Multiple tasks per hour supported
- Auto-scroll to current hour

### Soft Delete System
- Deleted tasks stored with timestamp
- "Today's deleted" view in trash
- Restore with undo option
- Permanent delete from trash

## 🔧 Configuration

### Priority Colors
Edit in `lib/providers/task_notifier.dart`:
```dart
extension TaskPriorityExtension on TaskPriority {
  Color get color {
    switch (this) {
      case TaskPriority.low: return Colors.green;
      case TaskPriority.medium: return Colors.blue;
      case TaskPriority.high: return Colors.orange;
      case TaskPriority.urgent: return Colors.red;
    }
  }
}
```

### Theme
Main theme in `lib/main.dart`:
```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  textTheme: GoogleFonts.jostTextTheme()
),
```
